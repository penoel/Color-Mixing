# Color-Mixing
This is a simple color mixing electronics kit.  It uses a potentiometer to change the voltage (simple voltage divider) on a RGB LED. This is done for the red, green, and blue.  These voltages also go to a single RGB LED that shows the mixing. The three colors require different amounts of power for the same intensity, so choose your resistor accordingly.
